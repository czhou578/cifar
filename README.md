# CIFAR 100 Classification

This was a project of mine that was built using PyTorch to classify the images from the CIFAR-100 dataset. I attempted to build my own model without using any pretrained model from online, in an effort to improve my machine learning skills and understanding. The final model achieves 64% test accuracy. 

This is is a full stack web application being powered by FastAPI on the backend for serving the model and a React + TypeScript frontend. Drag and drop any image of your choice onto the frontend and see what the model predicted for you!
